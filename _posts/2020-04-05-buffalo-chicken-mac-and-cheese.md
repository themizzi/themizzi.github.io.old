Quarntine kitchen got me to put this dish together. I was craving some velveeta shells and cheese, but also felt that was a little too easy with all this time on our hands. The buffalo sauce adds a good kick that isn't too much for the light hearted, but you can add more hot sauce while eating to spice it up even more.
