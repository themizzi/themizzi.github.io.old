I'm a David Chang fan. I started making this dish after going to his momofuku noodle bar in New York City and trying his Chilled Spicy Noodles. After perfecting this dish and returning to the same New York City etablishment to compare, I am annointing myself the champion of thai basil pesto noodles.

This is a double recipe. The pesto can be eaten right away, but tastes even better after a day in the fridge!
